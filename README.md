# Simple Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It takes two numbers and a mathematical operator as input and performs the corresponding calculation.

## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/).
* **Error Handling:**
    * Handles division by zero.
    * Handles invalid operator input.
* **Clear Output:** Displays the calculation and the result.

## How to Use

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x installed on your system.

2.  **Run the Program:**
    * Open a terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
    * Execute the program using the command: `python <your_script_name>.py` (replace `<your_script_name>.py` with the actual name of your Python file).

3.  **Input:**
    * The program will prompt you to enter the first number. Enter a numeric value.
    * The program will then prompt you to enter the second number. Enter another numeric value.
    * Finally, the program will prompt you to enter the operator. Enter one of the following: +, -, \*, /.

4.  **Output:**
    * If the input is valid, the program will display the calculation and the result.
    * If an error occurs (division by zero or invalid operator), an appropriate error message will be displayed.

## Example
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
